HYPERCUBE
---------
Hypercube is a 3D puzzle game of the Tetris genre, falling blocks which have to be positioned
correctly in order to stop the cube from filling up and to gain points. Each of the eight
levels has different facilities graded from easy to difficult.

You start on level 1. Only when the number of blocks for that level has been used can you
progress onto the next level. In order that you don't have to play through all the levels your
progress is automatically saved to disc. If you do not wish to save then leave the write
protect tag open on your disc.

The functions available to you at the start are, rotate the hypercube and rotate the falling
block. These rotate in steps of 90 degress clockwise each time you press the appropriate
button/key. The rotate occurs at the level below your block so some `mixing` of the cube is
possible. If you are too close to a side for rotating the falling block then it is refused.

On further levels random height blocks growing from the floor appear which make the positioning
of blocks harder. To compensate you can score extra points by letting your block fall on its
colour at the bottom. You can also destroy areas of the hypercube by using the bomb option.
You get a set number of `bombs` for a level. Detonating the bomb destroys your falling block
and a random area around it. This can clear areas to help complete levels when the going gets
tough. Extra bombs are awarded every 5000 points.

To complete a layer you have to position a certain number of blocks then that layer is wiped
out. This information is given in the status panel and increases by five for every completed
layer up to a maximum of 256 small cubes which is a full layer.

The high score table and the jump to level variable are saved to disc. If you do not want
then either remove the disc after loading or write protect it.

SCORING
-------
For each block dropped into the cube that lands on the ground
 = NUMBER OF SMALL CUBES IN BLOCK * LEVEL points.
 
For each cube touching the same colour SQUARE * LEVEL points, center starts at 10 and
decreases by 1 outwards.

For each layer eliminated LEVEL * 10 points.
